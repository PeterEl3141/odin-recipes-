        <li>wisk the egg yolks/egg together and season with salt, cheese, and pepper</li>
        <li>mix the pasta (along with one cup of the same water used to boil the pasta)

            together to this mix</li>
        <li>stir vigorously for several minutes until the eggy sauce surrounding
            the pasta has thickened
        </li>
